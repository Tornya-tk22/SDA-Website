        <h2 style="align-items: center;">History of the Sinyea SDA Elementary & Junior High School</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1em;">The sinyea SDA school wwas established during the year 1976 as Elementary
            School. This happened, after the construction of the church in 1975, when the officials of the church met with Mr. Robert Gibson to serve
            as a principal. The purpose of the school was to teach the church doctrine and help young prople with 
            quality education. Mr. Gibson accepted the idea and collaborated to open the school that very year. 
            Mr. Gibson served from 1976 - 1980 and was succeeded by Mr. Johnson Sando, from 1980 - 1984, Mr. Flomo S. Dorweh took
            over as a principal for the first tenure up to 1990.
            In 1991, the school year was distrupted beecause of the Liberian civil war as a result, Mr. Dorweh left for Monrovia. In 1992,
            Mr. Joseph Karbee took over as acting principal up to 2003. Due to some administrative reasons, the church administration deem it necessary to have
            contacted Mr. Samuel S. K. Gbellekoyah to come and serve as the new principal. Mr. Gbellekoyah served from 
            1992 - 1999. During his administration, he made a greate effort to have extended the school to a semi-Junior 
            High School (grade-8 Level). After he left, Mr. Flomo S. Dorweh again wass called by the church administration to come
            and take over the schoolbeing an experienced and qualified principal.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1em;">During 2001 - 2005 the school had two sessions: Morning and Afternoon. Mr. Harris
            F. Kerkulah served as the principal for the afternoon session whilw Mr. Dorweh still remained as the created 
            salary burden, the entire administration was challenged to meet regular salaries demand for teaching sraff.
            As a result the afternoon session was halted condition. Mr. Dorweh continued as pricipal up to 2014
            when he resiigned due tho his health condition. Mr. Aaron F. Jiaway being the long time serving registrar was appointed by the churrch administration to serveas the new principal. Mr. 
            Jiaway served from 2014 - 2016 and resigned on Aug. 12, 2016 at which time he recommended Mr. Roland Y. Kollie
            who succeeded him aas principal. Mr. Roland Y. Kollie served from 2016 - 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to some administrative reasons, Mr. Dargai E.G. Kollie was brought in by the church administration in collaboration with the Central 
            Liberia Mission to serve as principal. Mr. Kollie served as principal from 2021 - 2023. Again due to somw administrative 
            reasons, the local church in Sinyea Towm in collaboration with the Central Liberia Mission Education Director (Mr. Eld. Darwolor Kanasuah)
            decided to bring on board Mr. Harris J. Sumo Sr. who is now serrving as principal.
            All the school administration must  be commended for their tireless efforts and hard works in bringing the school this far.
            The school is now a fullflesd Junior High Schooland even intending to hace a srable Semi-Senior HHigh School
            this 2024-2025 academic year and onward.
